# Data Exercise 1

## Clone the Remote Repository

This will copy some program files to your ``htdocs`` folder.  

Go to [this link](https://github.com/barcaxi/csd2025) and download the repository ZIP file.  Copy the folder ``data`` into your XAMPP ``htdocs`` folder.

Check your ``htdocs`` folder.  You should have a new folder called ``data`` with some files in it.



## Part 1 - Iterations

1.	In your `data` folder modify the program file `myForOf.html` and `myForOf.js` that uses a `for of` loop to print the following using the `numbers` array:

	```
	var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
	```
	
	Expected output:
	```
	1
	2
	3
	4
	5

	Total = 15
	Average = 3
	```

	View it [here](http://localhost/data/myForOF.html) when done

1.	In your `data` folder create a new program file `myForEach1.html` and `myForEach1.js` that uses a `forEach()` to print the following for the `numbers` array:

	```
	var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
	```
	
	Expected output:
	```
	1 + 1 = 2
	2 + 2 = 4
	3 + 3 = 6
	4 + 4 = 8
	5 + 5 = 10
	```

1.	In your `data` folder create a new program file `myForEach2.html` and `myForEach2.js` that uses a `forEach()` to print the following for the `numbers` array:

	```
	var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
	```
	
	Expected output:
	```
	[1] ðŸ˜€
	[2] ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€
	[3] ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€
	[4] ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€
	[5] ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€
	```

	View [here](http://localhost/data/myForEach2.html) when done


## Part 2 - `filter()`


1.	In your `data` folder create a new program file `netflixTitlesByYear.html` and `netflixTitlesByYear.js` that uses a `filter()` function to filter the JSON data as shown here:
